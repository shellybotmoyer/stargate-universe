/**
 * Fullscreen + Escape-key capture.
 *
 * Goal: the game behaves like a native app — always fullscreen, with
 * Escape routed to the in-game menu instead of exiting fullscreen.
 *
 * Browser constraints:
 *  - `document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()` requires a user
 *    gesture. It cannot be called from main-module code at load time —
 *    the browser rejects it. We wait for the first pointerdown / key
 *    press and enter fullscreen from that handler.
 *  - Chrome's Keyboard Lock API (`navigator.keyboard.lock(["Escape"])`)
 *    prevents Escape from exiting fullscreen and instead delivers it as
 *    a normal keydown event — which our InputManager picks up as
 *    Action.Pause, routing it to the in-game menu or cinematic skip.
 *
 * Both APIs are available in Chrome / Edge / Electron; Firefox + Safari
 * don't support keyboard lock (Escape exits fullscreen there). The app
 * targets Chrome + eventual Electron wrapper, so this is a non-issue
 * for our shipping platform.
 *
 * Disable the whole thing by calling `disableFullscreenBehavior()` —
 * useful for dev (sometimes you want Escape to drop fullscreen so you
 * can see DevTools).
