# Stargate Universe — Destiny (browser game)

A third-person RPG aboard the Ancient ship *Destiny*, written in plain Three.js (0.180 via import map, ES modules, no
bundler). Five playable episodes (Air, Water, Darkness, Parts, Light), gate travel to procedural planets, an FTL jump window and story
countdowns with a no-death knockout loop, Kino drone, RPG layer, hydroponics harvest, in-game level
editor. This is the only game in the repo: the earlier Vite/ggez and Godot stacks were removed on 2026-09-08.

## Run / verify

- Dev: `python3 tools/edit_server.py 8090` → http://localhost:8090/ (or the `game` entry in `.claude/launch.json`).
  The server serves the repo root, accepts `PUT /data/*.json` from the level editor and pipes recorder frames into ffmpeg.
- Smoke: open `/?autoplay`, click New Game, run `window.__auto.run()`; `__auto.report` lists each chapter with `ok` and seconds.
  `/?autoplay&reload` reloads and resumes from the save at every chapter boundary (save/load coverage). All tabs on :8090
  share `localStorage['sgu.save']` — never run two smokes at once when one is in reload mode.
- Video proof: `/?autoplay&record`, `__rec.start('name')` … `__rec.stop()` → `~/Desktop/name.mp4` at a constant 30 fps.
- Ship: `./build.sh` → `dist/sgu-destiny-html5.zip` for itch.io (HTML project, index.html at zip root).
- Pre-commit: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (node --check on staged `src/*.js`, JSON validation). CI does the same plus a build.

## Key paths

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/main.js` | wiring: worlds, audio, interactables, quest triggers, save/load, game loop (rAF; timer + sub-steps when hidden; fixed step while recording) |
| `src/ship.js` | deck generated from `data/ship_layout.json` + `room_connections.json`; SGU doors; lights (nearest 6 live); merged static walls |
| `src/components.js` | prop registry `{type,u,v,ry,anchor,loot,style}` with meshes + colliders (console, relay, crate, scrubber, …) — the editor places these. Crates: `ancient` (lift-and-split lid) vs `pelican` (hinged), hollow, loot visible until taken via `setOpen(k)`/`takeLoot` |
| `src/quest.js` + `data/chapters.json` | declarative steps advance on flags; triggers on enter/exit |
| Story countdowns (`main.js` `tickCountdown`) | chapter triggers `{type:'countdown', seconds, label, cause}` / `countdown_stop`; expiry → `knockOut(cause)` (lines from `data/knockout_lines.json`) and re-arm. Kino Remote › CLOCKS lists every clock; Settings › Clock length scales them |
| FTL clock (`main.js` `tickFtl`) | every `ftl_drop` opens a jump window (`planet.window_seconds`, default 600 s); at zero Destiny jumps (emergency gate return if you are on the planet), then a 90 s cooldown and a re-drop while a planet step is current. HUD `#clock`, Ship tab row, saved. Console: `ftl [secs]` |
| `src/rpg.js`, `src/ui.js` | inventory/equipment/talents; HUD + Kino Remote; icons from `assets/items/` |
| `src/hotwire.js`, `src/flow.js` | repair mini-games: wire-matching (relay, elevator bus) and flow-balance (scrubber, water reclamation); both `play()` → Promise<boolean>, `isOpen()` pauses the sim |
| `src/player.js` | Quaternius UAL rig; gait clips locked to ground speed; footsteps from foot plants |
| `src/leveledit.js`, `src/console.js` | `` ` `` dev console; `leveledit` = first-person map builder in the live scene |
| `src/autoplay.js`, `src/recorder.js` | hands-free chapter driver (sim clock, per-frame waits); frame-pipe recorder |
| `tools/music-bake`, `tools/tts-bake` | ElevenLabs/TTS bake pipelines for `sounds/music/loops` and `sounds/dialog` |
| `design/gdd/` | engine-agnostic design docs — source of intent |
| `.ai/learnings/` | one lesson per file; read the relevant ones before extending a system |

## Conventions

- Tabs, `const`, arrow functions, async/await, 120 cols, kebab-case files. Data-driven: content in `data/*.json`, not code.
- Components: `ry` is the direction the prop FACES; its anchor (where the player stands) lies along `ry`.
- Coordinates: JSON units × 0.05 m; JSON X → world −Z, JSON Y → world X. Gate at the −Z end of the gate room.
- Never add lights casually: every visible PointLight recompiles into shader cost; `ship.js` keeps only the nearest 6 live.
- Any hidden-tab / timing work: read `.ai/learnings/hidden-tab-throttling-kills-raf-loops.md` and
  `record-fixed-step-frames-not-mediarecorder.md` first.
- Feature branches only (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`); commit + push before moving on; never force-push.
- One learning per file in `.ai/learnings/<lesson>.md` whenever something non-obvious is discovered.

## Directory cheatsheets

Each content directory has an `AGENTS.md` (data, sounds, sprites, design, docs, production, tools/music-bake). Read the local
one when entering a directory.
