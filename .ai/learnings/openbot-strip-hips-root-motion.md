# OpenBot (Mixamo-style) loop clips carry hips translation; strip it

**Symptom.** Walk/run loops drift the mesh away from its root when the controller also moves the root.

**Fix.** After `GLTFLoader`, filter out tracks whose name ends with `hips.position` from every clip
before creating actions. The controller owns world position; clips only rotate bones.

```js
for (const a of gltf.animations) a.tracks = a.tracks.filter((t) => !t.name.endsWith('hips.position'));
```

Same strip-hips idea applies to any Mixamo/OpenBot-style pack: gameplay code never
names a clip, and RM variants carry root motion separately — see
